Results suggest the merger increased legacy airlines' incentives to coordinate their pricing decisions. US Airways was disinclined to collude prior to the merger due to its unique route structure which was highly dependent on connecting products. The merger, by combining the networks of US Airways and American Airlines, homogenized the industry and increased the sustainability of collusion.},

	abstract = {AbstractIn December 1992, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit against eight major domestic airlines and the Airline Tariff Publishing (ATP) Company in order to reduce opportunities for collusion in the industry. The lawsuit ended with consent decrees limiting the ability of airlines to communicate surreptitiously through the shared fare database. This paper measures the effects of the litigation and its settlement on industry performance, comparing changes in outcomes between market segments that were more and less likely to be affected by the ATP case. Prices fell in response to the investigation but increased following the settlement, while the number of tickets sold in affected markets declined. The importance of multimarket contact also declined and then recovered. The ATP case had at best a temporary effect on airline collusion.},

Examining four cases of de-hubbing following U.S. airline mergers between 1998 and 2016, we analyze three product quality measures: on-time performance, travel time, and flight cancellations. In order to isolate a merger's impact on product quality, we compare the results of four de-hubbing events that followed a merger with three de-hubbing cases that occurred independently of a merger. We find a silver lining from mergers because product quality improvements are isolated to de-hubbing events which follow airline mergers rather than nonmerger-induced de-hubbing.},

	abstract = {Studies of airline mergers have largely focused on measuring the impact of mergers on average airfares. As a result, they may not sufficiently reveal the full range of price effects given the complexity of this industry. To address such industry intricacy, I investigate prices of merging firms and their rivals in response to the United-Continental merger on three types of routes: those include one or both endpoint airports as merging firms’ hubs (hub routes), those primarily consisting of price-sensitive leisure travelers (leisure routes), and those more likely to have both price-insensitive business passengers and leisure consumers (big-city routes). Results show that on hub routes, the merger creates hub premiums for merging firms and benefit legacy rivals rather than low-cost carrier rivals to raise fares. On big-city routes, the merging firms increase fares for business travelers but not for leisure passengers, and reduce prices for leisure travelers on leisure routes. Their legacy rivals increase fares on leisure routes but not on big-city routes. This finding suggests that a critical reason for inconsistent conclusions in previous research may be the failure to consider details of the airline industry.},

	abstract = {The effects of “low cost carriers” (LCCs) such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways on the competitive landscape of the U.S. airline industry have been thoroughly documented in the academic literature and the popular press. However, the more recent emergence of another distinct airline business model—the “ultra low cost carrier” (ULCC)—has received considerably less attention. By focusing on cost efficiencies and unbundled service offerings, the ULCCs have been able to undercut the fares of both traditional network and low-cost carriers in the markets they serve. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of ULCCs in the U.S. aviation industry and demonstrate how these carriers' business models, costs, and effects on air transportation markets differ from those of the traditional LCCs. We first describe the factors that have enabled ULCCs to achieve a cost advantage over traditional LCCs and network legacy carriers. Then, using econometric models, we examine the effects of ULCC and LCC presence, entry, and exit on base airfares in 3,004 U.S. air transportation markets from 2010 to 2015. We find that in 2015, ULCC presence in a market was associated with market base fares 21\% lower than average, as compared to an 8\% average reduction for LCC presence. We also find that while ULCC and LCC entry both result in a 14\% average reduction in fares one year after entry, ULCCs are three times as likely to abandon a market within two years of entry than are the LCCs. The results suggest that the ULCCs represent a distinct business model from traditional LCCs and that as the ULCCs grow, they will continue to play a unique and increasingly important role in the U.S. airline industry.},

The analysis measures the impact of in-market (i.e., airport-pair) competition and adjacent competition for both types of carriers, while also capturing the impact of potential competition from low-cost carriers. Moreover, this comprehensive approach is applied separately to two different types of markets, nonstop and connecting, which have not been simultaneously treated before within a single study. The results show that most forms of legacy-carrier competition have weak effects on average fares. Low-cost carrier competition, on the other hand, has dramatic fare impacts, whether it occurs on the airport-pair, at adjacent airports, or as potential competition.},

	abstract = {Southwest Airlines is frequently credited with having an important influence on the success of airline deregulation in the United States. This paper uses an original set of competition variables to estimate the extent of that influence in 1998. The estimated savings – due to actual, adjacent, and potential competition from Southwest – were \$12.9 billion. Southwest's low fares were directly responsible for \$3.4 billion of these savings to passengers. The remaining \$9.5 billion represents the effect that actual, adjacent, and potential competition from Southwest had on other carriers' fares. These savings amount to 20 per cent of the airline industry's 1998 domestic scheduled passenger revenue and slightly more than half the fare reductions attributed to airline deregulation. From a policy perspective, these results are both troubling and encouraging. On the one hand, it is troubling to find that a large part of the fare reductions from airline deregulation is due to one carrier. On the other hand, if entry by a carrier with the appropriate characteristics can make such a difference, policies that encourage entry – for example, relaxing the restriction on entry by foreign-owned carriers – may have a large impact on passenger welfare.},

	abstract = {While the US airline industry has been substantially transformed in recent years by the growth of low-cost airlines, the cost-saving benefits of lower airfares are difficult to gauge empirically. There are two important ways in which this paper contributes to the existing literature on the impact of the low-cost carriers (LCCs). First, the availability of route-level panel data allows us to examine the role of the LCCs in the long-run adjustment of airfares as well as the responses of the incumbent carriers to LCC entry and exit in a dynamic setting. Second, we capitalize on recent developments in spatial econometrics and explicitly model the spatial dependence among adjacent airline routes, an issue often ignored by previous studies. Although most of the pro-competitive effects of LCC entry take place after entry, we find evidence that the incumbent carriers also cut airfares in anticipation of entry by the LCCs. Moreover fares remain lower even after Southwest Airlines exits. Our empirical analysis confirms the spatial dependence among airfares in adjacent routes, provides estimates of the consumer benefits from lower airfares in routes affected by LCCs, and shows that there are substantial indirect benefits, i.e. lower fares in spatially-linked, nearby routes.},

Previous studies, however, have primarily focused on merger price effects, which is the net effect of these two forces. This paper attempts to decompose and measure these effects by using a model that allows us to derive proxies for market power and cost efficiency. In particular, we are interested in merger effects in markets where the merging airlines directly competed prior to their merger. We study two main mergers – Delta/Northwest and United/Continental – and find that both increase market power in markets where the merging airlines competed prior to merger. We also find evidence of marginal cost efficiencies associated with both mergers. These efficiency effects are relatively larger than the market power effects and come from different sources. In the case of the Delta/Northwest merger, efficiencies come from markets where the merging airlines competed prior to the merger, whereas in the case of United/Continental, they come from markets where the merging firms did not compete. The market power effects only stem from markets with pre-existing competition among merging airlines, perhaps due to the elimination of a competitor in those markets. These findings, thus, support the long-standing hypothesis that market power and efficiency are important in motivating horizontal mergers.},

I find that standard simulation methods, which measure the effect of the change in ownership on unilateral pricing incentives, do not generally provide an accurate forecast. By incorporating postmerger information into the model, I measure the relative importance of other factors that also contributed to the observed price changes. The results indicate that the unexplained component of the price change is largely accounted for by supply‐side effects. I conclude that deviations from the assumed model of firm conduct play an important role in accounting for the differences between the predicted and observed price changes. This conclusion suggests that the predictive performance of merger simulation would benefit if more flexible models of firm conduct were incorporated into the methodology.},

Previous researchers have concluded that the ready-to-eat cereal industry is a classic example of an industry with nearly collusive pricing behavior and intense nonprice competition. This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins. Leading firms are able to maintain a portfolio of differentiated products and influence the perceived product quality. It is these two factors that lead to high price-cost margins.},

Optimal choice behaviour is described by the interaction between the expenditure of resources on manipulability and the relative utility benefits gained from each of the alternatives. In this context, the theory proposes that the expected available capacity for an alternative has an explicit impact on consumer choice and should be used in demand estimation. Empirically, a two-limit seven (class) equation multivariate Tobit model of regional airline travel in Australia is estimated and confirms the importance of expected capacity constraints in explaining the demand for the different classes of air travel. The implications for airline class settings strategies are also discussed.},

We call such acquisitions “killer acquisitions.” We develop a model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer’s existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer’s market power is large because of weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate that 5.3\%–7.4\% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions. These acquisitions disproportionately occur just below thresholds for antitrust scrutiny.},

This article reviews and combines several recent advances related to the estimation of BLP-type problems and implements an extensible generic interface via the PyBLP package. Monte Carlo experiments and replications suggest different conclusions than the prior literature: multiple local optima appear to be rare in well-identified problems; good performance is possible even in small samples, particularly when “optimal instruments” are employed along with supply-side restrictions.

We construct a modified notion of upward pricing pressure called ccGUPPI, or capacity-constrained GUPPI, which accounts for upward pricing pressure from binding capacity constraints, in addition to standard merger effects. We show that the pricing pressure terms underlying ccGUPPI, calculated using premerger data, are sufficient to determine whether a merger of capacity-constrained firms will increase price, irrespective of the functional form of demand. Further, using Monte Carlo simulation, we show that ccGUPPI is generally a useful proxy for actual price effects, with lower informational requirements than full merger simulation.},

The results suggest that the Optimus–TMN merger would have resulted in 3.8\% higher prices and 14.9\% lower marginal costs, and would have been welfare-enhancing. These findings attest to the importance of the “efficiency defense” hypothesis of mergers. They suggest that competition authorities are warranted in allowing further consolidation in the telecom sector, but that consolidation should be accompanied by strict retail price–cap regulation.},

Based on the quarterly data from US T100 Domestic Segment database, we trace Southwest’s successful market entries from 1993 to 2016, and those of JetBlue from 2000 to 2016, and estimate a set of discrete choice models to investigate the factors that may attract or deter route entries by Southwest and JetBlue. These factors reflect route distance, traffic demand, market power of the carriers, route competition, and connectivity and traffic concentration at endpoint airports, etc. The paper also examines the similarity and dissimilarity between Southwest and JetBlue with respect to the effects of these factors on their entry decisions, and how their route entry decisions have evolved over time. Our results indicate that both Southwest and JetBlue are more likely to enter routes where they have higher market share in terms of traffic and connectivity at endpoint airports, but they are less likely to enter routes involving endpoint airports with higher concentration in either traffic or connectivity. While Southwest appears to prefer routes with short to medium distance in the 1990s, it has started to target longer distance routes since 2000. JetBlue has consistently preferred longer distance routes. While the number of legacy rivals on a given route may deter market entry by Southwest, it does not appear to have any significant effect on the entry decisions by JetBlue. Moreover, the presence of other LCCs may have deterred the market entry by Southwest during the 1993–1999 period, and by JetBlue during the 2000–2006 period, its entry-deterrence effects has been becoming less important as the two airlines continue their growth and market expansion. The results further suggest that Southwest has continued to be hesitant to enter routes that have asymmetric traffic volume at endpoint airports, but it has become more drawn to routes with broader connections and higher traffic at endpoint airports as it moves into the business passenger segment.},

Although dynamic pricing ensures seat availability for business travelers, these consumers are then charged higher prices.

Our results are based on the estimation of a dynamic game of network competition using data from the Airline Origin and Destination Survey with information on quantities, prices, and entry and exit decisions for every airline company in the routes between the 55 largest US cities. As methodological contributions of the paper, we propose and apply a method to reduce the dimension of the state space in dynamic games, and a procedure to deal with the problem of multiple equilibria when implementing counterfactual experiments. Our empirical results show that the most important factor to explain the adoption of hub-and-spoke networks is that the sunk cost of entry in a route declines importantly with the number of cities that the airline connects from the origin and destination airports of the route. For some carriers, the entry deterrence motive is the second most important factor to explain hub-and-spoke networks.},

This paper addresses the question of consistency and asymptotic distributions of instrumental variables estimates as the number of products increases in some commonly used models of demand under conditions on economic primitives. I show that, in a Bertrand–Nash equilibrium, product characteristics lose their identifying power as price instruments in the limit in certain cases, leading to inconsistent estimates. The reason is that product characteristic instruments achieve identification through correlation with markups, and, depending on the model of demand, the supply side can constrain markups to converge to a constant quickly relative to sampling error. I find that product characteristic instruments can yield consistent estimates in many of the cases I consider, but care must be taken in modeling demand and choosing instruments. A Monte Carlo study confirms that the asymptotic results are relevant in market sizes of practical importance.},

	abstract = {This study presents a structural model of the Korean airline industry and examines the effects of Korea’s Airline Deregulation Act of May 2008. We investigate the route-level impact of low-cost carrier (LCC) entries on air travel demand and incumbents’ strategic responses. We use a panel of airline-level data for each of the three Jeju Island routes, covering the 2006–2010 period, and find evidence for a common sensitivity to price across routes, but a route-specific response to flight characteristics. Air passengers favor frequent flights and larger aircraft. Moreover, departure flight schedules that are more spread out throughout the day provide higher utility for air passengers on high-volume routes. In the post-deregulation period, both legacy carriers lost sales on high-volume routes to emerging independent LCCs, but partly recouped those losses through their own subsidiary LCCs (dependent LCCs), by either replacing their previous services with their own LCCs or flying under a two-brand strategy. We empirically divide the price-cost markups into an own product-specific effect and a multiproduct firm-specific effect. This expansion of independent LCCs accounts for a substantial proportion of the two legacy carriers’ profit reductions, whereas the magnitude of the estimated profit losses varies widely depending on their strategic responses. In summary, the legacy carriers’ post-deregulation competitive behavior is far from collusive.},

When one of these new variates is added to an extreme-value (logistic) variate, the resulting distribution is also extreme value (logistic). Thus, quite complicated variance structures can be generated by recursively adding components having this new distribution, and the result will retain a marginal extreme-value (logistic) distribution. It is demonstrated that the computational simplicity of extreme-value error structures extends to the introduction of heterogeneity in duration, selection bias, limited-dependent- and qualitative-variable models. The usefulness of these new classes of distributions is illustrated with the examples of nested logit, multivariate risk, and competing risk models, where important generalizations to conventional stochastic structures are developed. The new models are shown to be computationally simpler and far more tractable than alternatives such as estimation by simulated moments. These results will be of considerable use to applied microeconomic researchers who have been hampered by computational difficulties in constructing more sophisticated estimators.},

The computational advantages of ABLP include (i) the linear approximation enables us to adopt an analytic inversion of the market share equations instead of a numerical inversion that BLP propose, (ii) ABLP solves the market share equations only at the optimum, and (iii) it minimizes over a typically small dimensional parameter space.

We specify a nonparametric random utility discrete choice model of demand allowing rich preference heterogeneity, product/market unobservables, and endogenous prices. Our supply model posits nonparametric cost functions, allows latent cost shocks, and nests a range of standard oligopoly models. We consider identification of demand, identification of changes in aggregate consumer welfare, identification of marginal costs, identification of firms' marginal cost functions, and discrimination between alternative models of firm conduct. We explore two complementary approaches. The first demonstrates identification under the same nonparametric instrumental variables conditions required for identification of regression models. The second treats demand and supply in a system of nonparametric simultaneous equations, leading to constructive proofs exploiting exogenous variation in demand shifters and cost shifters. We also derive testable restrictions that provide the first general formalization of Bresnahan's (1982) intuition for empirically distinguishing between alternative models of oligopoly competition. From a practical perspective, our results clarify the types of instrumental variables needed with market level data, including tradeoffs between functional form and exclusion restrictions.},

I recover estimates of markups, defined as the ratio of price to marginal cost, at the airline-time level. Dominant carriers in the industry have substantially increased their markups in the last decade. The findings indicate an increase in market power: The increase in markups is not explained by proportionally higher fixed costs or a larger scale elasticity. In contrast, the net profit rate has dramatically increased for these carriers. I rely on these markup estimates and structural modeling to test if this recent increase in markups can be explained by a change in airlines’ conduct (coordinating behavior). The model rejects the null hypothesis of no increase in coordinating behavior for dominant carriers. Counterfactual simulations imply that the consumer surplus is, on average, 17\% lower than it would have been under no change in conduct, and that prices are 10\% higher.},

I recover productivity, markup, and marginal cost estimates for each airline using production and cost data. I then employ these estimates, a panel event study design, and synthetic control methods to estimate the effects of mergers on these outcomes. I find that in most cases, mergers have not significantly affected merging parties’ productive efficiency, and in a few cases, have increased marginal costs. Some mergers, such as the American-US Airways merger, have substantially increased the markups charged. The increase in markups is not explained by efficiencies, proportionally higher fixed costs, or changes in technology (i.e., a larger scale elasticity). Instead, the net profit rate has increased for these carriers after the mergers. Indirect evidence suggests that quality effects cannot account fully for the observed markup changes. Taken together, these findings point to an increase in market power.},

Despite the fact that the PFC cap has declined in real terms since 2001, I find that regulators have given greater importance to airports since the turn of the century. There are a number of recent proposals to increase the price cap and, at a minimum, restore the cap to 2001 real levels. I find that a price cap decrease would instead be necessary to maintain the preferences of regulators in 2001.},

Together with the expansion of low-cost carriers, they explain more than 80 percent of legacy carriers' variable profit reduction. (JEL L13, L25, L93)},

The restrictions are that a conditional expectation of this function is zero at some point in the parameter space; this point is to be estimated. If F is assumed to be a multinomial distribution with known (finite) support, then the problem becomes parametric and the bound can be obtained from the information matrix. This bound turns out to depend only upon certain conditional moments, and not upon the support of the distribution. Since a general F can be approximated by a multinomial distribution, the multinomial bound applies to the general case.},

Consumer gains/losses associated with quality changes, which we monetize, are substantial.},

With respect to the empirical literature on entry games originated by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992), the main novelty of our framework is to allow for general forms of heterogeneity across players without making equilibrium selection assumptions. We allow the effects that the entry of each individual airline has on the profits of its competitors, its “competitive effects,” to differ across airlines. The identified features of the model are sets of parameters (partial identification) such that the choice probabilities predicted by the econometric model are consistent with the empirical choice probabilities estimated from the data. We apply this methodology to investigate the empirical importance of firm heterogeneity as a determinant of market structure in the U.S. airline industry. We find evidence of heterogeneity across airlines in their profit functions. The competitive effects of large airlines (American, Delta, United) are different from those of low cost carriers and Southwest. Also, the competitive effect of an airline is increasing in its airport presence, which is an important measure of observable heterogeneity in the airline industry. Then we develop a policy experiment to estimate the effect of repealing the Wright Amendment on competition in markets out of the Dallas airports. We find that repealing the Wright Amendment would increase the number of markets served out of Dallas Love.},

A large literature in econometrics develops procedures for detecting weak instruments and constructing robust conﬁdence sets, but many of the results in this literature are limited to settings with independent and homoskedastic data, while data encountered in practice frequently violate these assumptions. We review the literature on weak instruments in linear IV regression with an emphasis on results for non-homoskedastic (heteroskedastic, serially correlated, or clustered) data. To assess the practical importance of weak instruments, we also report tabulations and simulations based on a survey of papers published in the American Economic Review from 2014 to 2018 that use instrumental variables. These results suggest that weak instruments remain an important issue for empirical practice, and that there are simple steps researchers can take to better handle weak instruments in applications.},

made useful progress in measuring broad trends in markups. However, industries are so heterogeneous that careful industry-specific studies are also required, and 
sorely needed. Examples of such studies illustrate differing explanations for rising markups, including endogenous increases in fixed costs associated with lower 
marginal costs. In some industries there is evidence of price increases driven by mergers. To fully understand markups, we must eventually recover the key economic 
primitives of demand, marginal cost, and fixed and sunk costs. We end by discussing the various aspects of antitrust enforcement that may be of increasing 
importance regardless of the cause of increased markups.},

Rather, identification relies primarily on the standard requirement that instruments be available for the endogenous variables—here, typically, prices and quantities. We discuss the types of instruments that can suffice, as well as how instrumental variables requirements can be relaxed by the availability of individual-level data or through restrictions on preferences. We also review new results on discrimination between alternative models of oligopoly competition.

	abstract = {Objective
Risk assessment and response is important for understanding human behavior. The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political “Left” diverge from those on the “Right”). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions.

Method
Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing).

Results
Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors.

Conclusions
Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived “common ground,” between the political “Right” and “Left.” Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology.},

	abstract = {Stance detection is an evolving opinion mining research area motivated by the vast increase in the variety and volume of user-generated content. In this regard, considerable research has been recently carried out in the area of stance detection. In this study, we review the different techniques proposed in the literature for stance detection as well as other applications such as rumor veracity detection. Particularly, we conducted a systematic literature review of empirical research on the machine learning (ML) models for stance detection that were published from January 2015 to October 2022. We analyzed 96 primary studies, which spanned eight categories of ML techniques. In this paper, we categorize the analyzed studies according to a taxonomy of six dimensions: approaches, target dependency, applications, modeling, language, and resources. We further classify and analyze the corresponding techniques from each dimension’s perspective and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. The analysis reveals that deep learning models that adopt a mechanism of self-attention have been used more frequently than the other approaches. It is worth noting that emerging ML techniques such as few-shot learning and multitask learning have been used extensively for stance detection. A major conclusion of our analysis is that despite that ML models have shown to be promising in this field, the application of these models in the real world is still limited. Our analysis lists challenges and gaps to be addressed in future research. Furthermore, the taxonomy presented can assist researchers in developing and positioning new techniques for stance detection-related applications.},

The main disadvantage of supervised machine learning is the need for thousands of manually annotated training data points. This issue is particularly important in the social sciences where most new research questions require new training data for a new task tailored to the specific research question. This paper analyses how deep transfer learning can help address this challenge by accumulating “prior knowledge” in language models. Models like BERT can learn statistical language patterns through pre-training (“language knowledge”), and reliance on task-specific data can be reduced by training on universal tasks like natural language inference (NLI; “task knowledge”). We demonstrate the benefits of transfer learning on a wide range of eight tasks. Across these eight tasks, our BERT-NLI model fine-tuned on 100 to 2,500 texts performs on average 10.7 to 18.3 percentage points better than classical models without transfer learning. Our study indicates that BERT-NLI fine-tuned on 500 texts achieves similar performance as classical models trained on around 5,000 texts. Moreover, we show that transfer learning works particularly well on imbalanced data. We conclude by discussing limitations of transfer learning and by outlining new opportunities for political science research.},

Using comprehensive data and internal models from a large U.S. airline, we establish that airline pricing is not well approximated by a model of the firm as a unitary decision maker. We show that observed prices, however, can be rationalized by accounting for organizational structure and for the decisions by departments that are tasked with supplying inputs to the observed pricing heuristic. Simulating the prices the firm would charge if it were a rational, unitary decision maker results in lower welfare than we estimate under observed practices. Finally, we discuss why counterfactual estimates of welfare and market power may be biased if prices are set through decomposition, but we instead assume that they are set by unitary decision makers.},

To estimate the model, we use unique data from international airline markets with flight-level variation in prices across time, cabins, and markets and information on passengers’ reasons for travel and time of purchase. The current pricing practice yields approximately 77\% of the first-best welfare. The source of this inefficiency arises primarily from private information about passenger valuations, not dynamic uncertainty about demand. We also find that if airlines could discriminate between business and leisure passengers, total welfare would improve at the expense of business passenger surplus. Also, replacing the current pricing that involves screening passengers across cabin classes with offering a single cabin class has minimal effect on total welfare.},

These carriers have significantly lower unit costs than do traditional “low-cost carriers” (LCCs), and the ULCCs focus almost exclusively on leisure travelers, and offer unbundled products with low base fares and fees for many ancillary services. Public statements in carriers’ earnings calls from 2012 to 2019 indicate that “legacy carriers” responded to ULCC expansion by increasing fare segmentation and further reducing fares at the bottom of the fare distribution. Using data from 2012Q1 to 2019Q4, I show that ULCC presence significantly widens fare dispersion, whereas competition from legacy carriers and LCCs does not meaningfully affect fare dispersion in most cases. More generally, my results show that failing to account for firm-level heterogeneity could lead to inappropriate conclusions about the relationship between competition and price dispersion.},

	abstract = {Consumers often consider delaying a purchase strategically, anticipating that prices might decrease. Combining two unique data sources from the air-travel industry (posted fare data and booking data), we use a structural model to estimate the fraction of strategic consumers in the population, assuming different levels of sophistication in consumers' perception of future prices: perfect foresight and weak- and strong-form rational expectations. We find that 5.2\% to 19.2\% of the population is strategic across markets, measured by the first and third quartiles. Our intermarket analysis indicates that shorter trips with more attractive outside options are populated with more strategic consumers. Using a nonparametric approach, we further find that most strategic consumers arrive either at the beginning of the booking horizon or close to departure. Finally, our counterfactual analysis shows that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the presence of strategic consumers does not necessarily hurt revenues. Rather, the impact varies by market. Commitment to a nondecreasing pricing strategy is more likely to benefit business markets than leisure markets, or it could even hurt leisure markets. Intermarket analysis shows that city pairs with lower Internet penetration, higher average price, and shorter distances tend to benefit more from such commitment as well.

We derive numerical theory results characterizing the properties of the nested fixed point algorithm used to evaluate the objective function of BLP's estimator. We discuss problems with typical implementations, including cases that can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. As a solution, we recast estimation as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which can be faster and which avoids the numerical issues associated with nested inner loops. The advantages are even more pronounced for forward-looking demand models where the Bellman equation must also be solved repeatedly. Several Monte Carlo and real-data experiments support our numerical concerns about the nested fixed point approach and the advantages of constrained optimization. For static BLP, the constrained optimization approach can be as much as ten to forty times faster for large-dimensional problems with many markets.},

	abstract = {Previous research has suggested that codeshare agreements
eliminate double marginalization that exists when unaffiliated
airlines independently determine the price for different segments
of an interline trip. Using a structural econometric model, this
paper investigates whether codeshare contracts do eliminate
double marginalization. The results suggest that both upstream
and downstream margins persist when the operating carrier of a
codeshare product also offers competing single-carrier product(s) in
the concerned market. Furthermore, counterfactual simulations from
the model suggest that efficient pricing of these codeshare products
would lower their price, and yield nontrivial increases in consumer
welfare.},

	abstract = {Household saving soared in the United States and other high-income economies during the pandemic, as consumers cut back on spending while government policies supported incomes. More recently, saving behavior has diverged, with the U.S. saving rate dropping below its pre-pandemic average while saving rates elsewhere have remained above their pre-pandemic averages. As a result, U.S. consumers have been spending down the "excess savings" built up during the pandemic while the excess savings abroad remain untapped. This divergent behavior helps explain why U.S. GDP has returned to its pre-pandemic trend path even as GDP levels in other high-income economies continue to run well below trend.},
